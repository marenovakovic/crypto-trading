KMP version of this project is being developed, I'll delete this when it's done so if you are reading this know that KMP is in the works and will be done.
This meets the requirements so I submitted it but I didn't get green light to proceed with KMP when I initially started.
When KMP project is done I will link it here.

If I had more time I would refine refresh mecanism. If it takes too long to load the data on 5 second mark I'd show some info to the user... or something similar.
And I'll add UI and screenshot tests.
